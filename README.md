# Git Immersion Projects

This project section is a practice area for me to:

1. Practice using GIT from the Linux command line; and
2. Experimenting with Git Markdown language (yes, I though md might have stood for Maryland).

Here are the external resources I used to figure this out:

..* The Markdown Cheatsheet by adam-p can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown Cheatsheet")

..* Instructions via GitHub Help on how to remote push into your Github account from the CL can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/ "GitHub Help Page")

..* NEO's Git Immersion tutorial can be found [here](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html "Markdown Cheatsheet")
