# Git Immersion Projects

This project section is a practice area for me to:

1. Practice using GIT from the Linux command line; and
2. Experimenting with Git Markdown language.

Here are the external resources I used to figure this out:

* The Markdown Cheatsheet by adam-p can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown Cheatsheet")

* Instructions via GitHub Help on how to remote push into your Github account from the CL for a FRESH GIT PROJECT/REPO can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/ "GitHub Help Page")

* NEO's Git Immersion tutorial can be found [here](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html "Markdown Cheatsheet")

###Download your clone!

Please remember that updating the GIT project requires you to clone (from your GitHub page) the project to your computer, before adding files. [viz](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ "Cloning Repository from Linux")

###Upload your new file

Please remember to check your origin with "git remote -v", before adding files. [viz](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/ "Adding a file to the Repository from Linux")


Summary of GIT workflow process using CL is as follows:

1.  Create Git Project/repository on CL - use above links to push project into existence
2.  Download/clone Git project/repository from GitHub website to your computer
3.  Upload file from same directory you cloned the repo, back to the website.
